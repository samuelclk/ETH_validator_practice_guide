# Welcome to the practice session

### Why do we practice?

Running an ETH validator node is a high stakes operation.&#x20;

Unfamiliarity with the node operations process can lead to anxiety and knee-jerk reactions when the variables in your environment change even slightly - which in turn can lead to an increased risk of getting slashed.&#x20;

This is why you need to get your practice hours in to build your confidence before going live on mainnet.

### A free way to practice

Fortunately for us, we can practice for free using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) without needing to invest in physical hardware and only make the purchase when we feel ready.

New GCP users will enjoy $300 of credits - enough to let us practice for at least 3 months.

Even if you have used up all your GCP credits, the hourly rate is only at $0.20 and you can simply stop your virtual machine once you are done practicing for the day - still a super cheap method compared to buying dedicated node hardware!

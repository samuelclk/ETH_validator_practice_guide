# Welcome to the practice session

## Why do we practice?

_<mark style="background-color:red;">Running an ETH validator node is a high stakes operation.</mark>_&#x20;

Unfamiliarity with the node operations process can lead to anxiety and knee-jerk reactions when the variables in your environment change even slightly - which in turn can lead to an increased risk of getting slashed.&#x20;

This is why you need to get your practice hours in to build your confidence before going live on mainnet.

## A free way to practice

Fortunately for us, we can practice for free using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) without needing to invest in physical hardware and only make the purchase when we feel ready.

New GCP users will enjoy $300 of credits - enough to let us practice for at least 3 months.

Even if you have used up all your GCP credits, you can still spin up a virtual machine at an hourly rate of only $0.20. This means you can simply stop your virtual machine once you are done practicing for the day - still a super cheap method compared to buying dedicated node hardware!

## Important note:

This practice guide is based on the Goerli testnet and should not be used for validator operations on the ETH mainnet.

This guide covers only the most basic validator node setup as it is meant for people with zero prior experience in this domain. Future guides will include sections on more advanced topics like configuring MEV-boost, node monitoring solutions, external signers, and redundancy setups.

This guide references and builds upon several other guides that came before mine and I could not have been able to run my own validator nodes without them.
